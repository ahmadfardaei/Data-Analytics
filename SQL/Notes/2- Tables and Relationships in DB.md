Instead of having just one table, a database can have multiple tables. A very large table (in terms of the number of columns–attributes– not the number of records–rows–) can be divided into smaller ones; we just need to know how they are **relating** to each other. On the other hand, if there are some tables that are related to each other, can be unified and create one table.

To do so, we need a **relational database**; a database that we can define the relationships between the tables.
