## Database and Database Management System
We live in the age of Data; Whatever we do, see, hear, or even many things we are unaware of, is a form of data. To interact with, store, manage and use the information (data), we use tools called **Database (DB)**. So basically Database is any collection of related information that can be stored. _**Example**: to-do list (on a piece of paper or apps or whatever), Phone book, Amazon’s customers’ info including credit card, address, purchase history,..._ 

It is obvious that more complex (amount of data, the relation between them, and so on) and important information require advanced tools to secure and manage them. To do so, we use **Database Management Systems (DBMS)** which ironically are not an actual database, but a software program that helps users create and maintain a database to:

- Manage large amounts of information
- Handle Security and Backups
- Import and Export Data to interact with software applications

In fact, they are like a middle-man, between the database and the ones who want to use it.

> **CRUD**–stands for **Create**, **Read (Retrieve)**, **Update**, **Delete**–are the four main operations we do with DataBases.

## Data storage and Types of Databases 

The way data is stored defines the type of database. We have two general categories for forms of stored data:
- **Tables**
- **Anything but tables** :sweat_smile: No I'm not kidding!

Let's take a look at them:

|Tables|Anything but tables|
|---|---|
|'''Has rows and columns: - Every row in a table stores one record - Every column has some attribute of that record.
